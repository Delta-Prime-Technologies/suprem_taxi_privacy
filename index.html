        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: July 15, 2025</p>

        <h2>The Scope of This Policy</h2>
        <p>This policy applies to all Mi Softwares users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all Mi Softwares platforms and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other services (collectively, the "Mi Softwares Platform"). Please remember that your use of the Mi Softwares Platform is also subject to our Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use the Mi Softwares Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like third-party services, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:</p>

        <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p><strong>Account Registration.</strong> When you create an account with Mi Softwares, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your preferred pronouns).</p>

        <p><strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), driver's license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).</p>

        <p><strong>SOS Contact Information.</strong> We will collect the contact list permission to list the contacts while adding the SOS contacts for user & driver app.</p>

        <p><strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or Drivers, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.</p>

        <p><strong>Communications.</strong> When you contact us or we contact you, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us.</p>

        <h3>B. Information We Collect When You Use the Mi Softwares Platform</h3>
        <p><strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The Mi Softwares Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your Mi Softwares app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Riders:</strong> We collect your device's precise location when you open and use the Mi Softwares app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. Mi Softwares also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.</li>
            <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> We collect your device's precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Mi Softwares Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information about your interactions with the Mi Softwares Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.</p>

        <p><strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access the Mi Softwares Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data).</p>

        <p><strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party's actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the participants' phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Mi Softwares Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.</p>

        <p><strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Mi Softwares access to your contact lists and direct Mi Softwares to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Mi Softwares. If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information through the use of "cookies", tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Mi Softwares Platform and interact with Mi Softwares advertisements, to make your Mi Softwares experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the Mi Softwares Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of the Mi Softwares Platform.</p>

        <h3>C. Information We Collect from Third Parties</h3>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> Third-party services provide us with information needed for core aspects of the Mi Softwares Platform, as well as for additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your Mi Softwares experience. These third-party services include background check providers, insurance partners, financial service providers, marketing providers, and other businesses. We obtain the following information about you from these third-party services:</p>

            <li>Information about you provided by specific services, such as demographic and market segment information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Enterprise Programs.</strong> If you use Mi Softwares through your employer or other organization that participates in one of our Mi Softwares Business enterprise programs, we will collect information about you from those parties, such as your name and contact information.</p>

        <p><strong>Concierge Service.</strong> Sometimes another business or entity may order you a Mi Softwares ride. If an organization has ordered a ride for you using our Concierge service, they will provide us your contact information and the pickup and drop-off location of your ride.</p>

        <p><strong>Referral Programs.</strong> Friends help friends use the Mi Softwares Platform. If someone refers you to Mi Softwares, we will collect information about you from that referral including your name and contact information.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Users and Sources.</strong> Other users or public or third-party sources such as law enforcement, insurers, media, or pedestrians may provide us information about you, for example as part of an investigation into an incident or to provide you support.</p>

        <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. To make the Mi Softwares Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.</p>

        <h3>A. Sharing Between Mi Softwares Users</h3>
        <p><strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rider information shared with Driver:</strong> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider's pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider's destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Mi Softwares app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider's rating and feedback with the Driver.</li>
            <li><strong>Driver information shared with Rider:</strong> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver's name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver's Mi Softwares profile.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Mi Softwares Shared ride, we share each Rider's name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other's pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.</p>

        <p><strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Mi Softwares Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a subsidized program, or a corporate credit card linked to another account, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party.</p>

        <p><strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Mi Softwares Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Mi Softwares Platform with that user.</p>

        <h3>B. Sharing With Third-Party Service Providers for Business Purposes</h3>
        <p>Depending on whether you're a Rider or a Driver, Mi Softwares may share the following categories of your personal information for a business purpose to provide you with a variety of the Mi Softwares Platform's features and services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identifiers, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, government identification number, driver's license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information;</li>
            <li>Financial information, such as bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information you provide us;</li>
            <li>Commercial information, such as ride information, Driver/Rider statistics and feedback, and Driver/Rider transaction history;</li>
            <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as your IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, carrier and/or manufacturer, device identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers; and</li>
            <li>Location data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. For Legal Reasons and to Protect the Mi Softwares Platform</h3>
        <p>We may share your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with any applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation or legal process, or enforceable governmental request;</li>
            <li>Respond to legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena, summons, or court order);</li>
            <li>Enforce our Terms of Service;</li>
            <li>Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that we reasonably and in good faith believe may violate federal, state, or local law; or</li>
            <li>Exercise or defend legal claims, protect against harm to our rights, property, interests, or safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>D. In Connection with Sale or Merger</h3>

        <h3>E. Upon Your Further Direction</h3>
        <p>With your permission or upon your direction, we may disclose your personal information to interact with a third party or for other purposes.</p>

        <h2>How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>
        <p>We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Mi Softwares Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the "Deleting Your Account" section below. We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information, including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights And Choices Regarding Your Data</h2>
        <p>Mi Softwares provides ways for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise other data rights that give you certain control over your personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookie Tracking.</strong> You can modify your cookie settings on your browser, but if you delete or choose not to accept our cookies, you may be missing out on certain features of the Mi Softwares Platform.</p>

        <p><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want them to track your online activities. The Mi Softwares Platform does not currently support Do Not Track requests at this time.</p>

        <p><strong>Deleting Your Account.</strong> If you would like to delete your Mi Softwares account, please visit our privacy homepage. In some cases, we will be unable to delete your account, such as if there is an issue with your account related to trust, safety, or fraud.</p>
